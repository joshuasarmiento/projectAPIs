Even when purchasing anything online, the item is reserved for the potential buyer. The more resources and other dynamic elements a system possesses, the more processing must be performed.",
			"According to the findings of the usability test that was done in the areas of shop owners and clients, the users were able to appreciate the application. The client was able to book their desired services without having to walk to the shop. The shop owner was able to evaluate the appointments set by the user and accept or reject them in a timely manner.",
			"The test resulted in an overall positive response, with client users successfully completing the appointment schedule via the mobile application. Using the formula in calculating the SUS score, Client application got a average score of 75% while the shop owner application with the average score of 68%."

			"The current program application process causing a lot of concerns which are; documents are mixed up or even forgotten by the supervisors because itâ€™s voluminous, supervisors sometimes forget to prepare follow-up letters for HEIs because of the unorganized documents, and HEIs operating programs even without the corresponding government authority, HEIs non-observance of the timelines causing a delay in application progress, and the Commission issuing Special Order for Graduation which all leads to delays in the issuance of corresponding government authority for HEIs.",
